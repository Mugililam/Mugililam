About Me
I am passionate about data analysis and have conducted various analyses, including location, transport links, schooling, property price, rental value, property types, market research, and financial analysis. My work has included feasibility studies and cost-benefit analyses for property investments, helping to make informed decisions and maximize return on investment.

I am currently enrolled in a 12-week intensive Digital Skills Bootcamp in Data with Just IT Training. This program is helping me build on my existing skills and develop new ones to advance my career as a data analyst. I have completed several data projects using Excel, SQL, Python, R, Tableau, and Power BI. You can find these projects in my GitHub and Tableau Public portfolios.

My immediate goal is to become more established in the role of a Data Technician or Apprentice. I aim to work with like-minded individuals from whom I can learn and grow during these crucial years of my development.
